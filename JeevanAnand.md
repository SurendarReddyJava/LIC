The LIC Jeevan Anand Plan is a traditional endowment insurance policy offered by the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). It’s a participating, non-linked plan that blends savings with lifelong protection, making it distinct from many other endowment plans. Over the years, LIC has introduced different versions of this plan, such as Plan 149 (older version) and Plan 915 (launched in 2015), with slight tweaks in features. Below is an overview based on the most common and recent iteration, particularly Plan 915, unless specified otherwise.

### Key Features
- **Type**: Non-linked, participating endowment plan (earns bonuses based on LIC’s profits).
- **Purpose**: Combines maturity benefits with lifelong life cover, even after the policy term ends.
- **Sum Assured**: Minimum of ₹1,00,000, no upper limit (in multiples of ₹5,000 or ₹10,000 depending on the version).
- **Policy Term**: Ranges from 15 to 35 years (varies by version and age).
- **Premium Payment Term**: Equal to the policy term (e.g., pay for 20 years for a 20-year term).
- **Premium Modes**: Monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or yearly.
- **Eligibility**:
  - Minimum entry age: 18 years.
  - Maximum entry age: 50 years (for Plan 915).
  - Maximum maturity age: 75 years (for Plan 915).

### Benefits
1. **Maturity Benefit**:
   - If the policyholder survives the policy term (with all premiums paid):
     - Basic Sum Assured + Simple Reversionary Bonuses + Final Additional Bonus (if any) are paid as a lump sum.
   - After maturity, the life cover continues for the policyholder’s lifetime.

2. **Death Benefit**:
   - **During Policy Term**: If the policyholder dies during the term (premiums paid up to date):
     - 125% of Basic Sum Assured (or 10 times the annualized premium, whichever is higher) + accrued Simple Reversionary Bonuses + Final Additional Bonus (if any) are paid to the nominee.
     - The policy terminates after this payout.
   - **After Policy Term**: If the policyholder dies after maturity (post-term), the nominee receives the Basic Sum Assured again, regardless of the earlier maturity payout. No bonuses apply here.
   - This lifelong cover is a standout feature.

3. **Bonuses**:
   - **Simple Reversionary Bonus**: Declared annually by LIC, added to the policy if it’s in force.
   - **Final Additional Bonus**: A one-time bonus paid at maturity or death during the term, based on the policy term and LIC’s performance.

4. **Tax Benefits**:
   - Premiums paid are eligible for tax deductions under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.
   - Maturity and death benefits are tax-exempt under Section 10(10D), subject to conditions.

5. **Optional Riders** (available in some versions):
   - **Accidental Death and Disability Benefit Rider**: Extra payout for accidental death or disability.
   - **New Term Assurance Rider**: Additional life cover for an extra premium.
   - Riders increase costs but enhance protection.

6. **Loan Facility**:
   - Available after paying premiums for at least 2-3 years, based on the policy’s surrender value.

7. **Surrender Value**:
   - Can be surrendered after a minimum premium payment period (e.g., 3 years), with a guaranteed surrender value plus accrued bonuses.

### How It Works (Example)
Suppose Ms. Priya, aged 30, buys a Jeevan Anand Plan (915) with:
- Sum Assured: ₹5,00,000.
- Policy Term: 20 years.
- Annual Premium: ~₹28,000 (approx., varies by age and term).

- **If Priya survives till maturity (age 50)**:
  - She receives ₹5,00,000 + bonuses (e.g., ₹2,00,000, assuming moderate rates) + Final Additional Bonus (e.g., ₹25,000) = ₹7,25,000 (approx.).
  - Life cover of ₹5,00,000 continues for her lifetime post-maturity.

- **If Priya dies during the term (e.g., year 10, age 40)**:
  - Nominee gets 125% of ₹5,00,000 = ₹6,25,000 + bonuses (e.g., ₹1,00,000) + Final Additional Bonus (e.g., ₹10,000) = ₹7,35,000 (approx.).
  - Policy ends.

- **If Priya dies after maturity (e.g., age 60)**:
  - After receiving ₹7,25,000 at maturity (age 50), her nominee gets ₹5,00,000 upon her death at 60, with no additional bonuses.

### Versions of Jeevan Anand
- **Plan 149**: Older version, launched decades ago, discontinued in 2014.
- **Plan 915**: New Jeevan Anand, introduced on February 1, 2015, with updated terms and higher death benefits (e.g., 125% of Sum Assured).
- Older versions may differ in eligibility or payout structure.

### Pros
- Lifelong coverage even after maturity, unique among endowment plans.
- Combines savings (maturity) with protection (death benefit).
- Tax benefits and loan facility add value.
- Bonuses boost returns over time.

### Cons
- Returns are modest (typically 5.5%-6.5% annually), not beating inflation or market-linked options like mutual funds.
- Long-term commitment with limited liquidity.
- Better as insurance than a high-return investment.

### Availability
- Not available online directly via LIC’s website. Contact an LIC agent or visit a branch.
