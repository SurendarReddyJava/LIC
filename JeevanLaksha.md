The LIC Jeevan Lakshya Plan is a popular endowment insurance policy offered by the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). It is a participating, non-linked plan that combines protection and savings, designed to provide financial security for your family. There have been multiple versions of this plan over the years, with different table numbers (e.g., 833, 933, 733), each launched at different times with slight variations. Below is an overview based on the most common features of the Jeevan Lakshya Plan, particularly focusing on the widely recognized versions.

Key Features
Type: Non-linked, participating endowment plan (earns bonuses based on LIC’s profits).
Purpose: Offers a mix of life cover and savings, ensuring financial support for your family in case of your demise and a lump sum at maturity if you survive the term.
Sum Assured: Minimum of ₹1,00,000, with no upper limit (in multiples of ₹10,000).
Policy Term: Typically ranges from 13 to 25 years, depending on the version.
Premium Payment Term: Limited premium payment, shorter than the policy term (e.g., policy term minus 3 years in some versions).
Premium Modes: Monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or yearly.
Eligibility:
Minimum entry age: 18 years.
Maximum entry age: 50 years.
Maximum maturity age: 65 years.
Benefits
Death Benefit:
If the policyholder passes away during the policy term (with premiums paid up to date):
Annual Income Benefit: 10% of the Basic Sum Assured is paid to the nominee every year from the policy anniversary following the death until the year before maturity.
Lump Sum on Maturity: On the maturity date, 110% of the Basic Sum Assured plus accrued Simple Reversionary Bonuses and Final Additional Bonus (if any) are paid.
Ensures a steady income for the family (e.g., for children’s education) plus a final payout.
Maturity Benefit:
If the policyholder survives the policy term:
Basic Sum Assured + Simple Reversionary Bonuses + Final Additional Bonus (if any) are paid as a lump sum.
The exact amount depends on the bonuses declared by LIC over the years.
Bonuses:
Simple Reversionary Bonus: Added annually based on LIC’s profits, provided the policy is in force.
Final Additional Bonus: A one-time bonus paid at maturity or death, depending on the policy term and LIC’s performance.
Tax Benefits:
Premiums paid qualify for tax deductions under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.
Maturity and death benefits are tax-exempt under Section 10(10D), subject to conditions.
Optional Riders (available in some versions):
Accidental Death and Disability Benefit Rider: Provides additional payout in case of accidental death or disability.
New Term Assurance Rider: Offers extra life cover for an additional premium.
Riders enhance the policy’s protection but require extra premiums.
Loan Facility:
Available after paying premiums for at least 2-3 years (varies by version), based on the surrender value.
Surrender Value:
Can be surrendered after a minimum premium payment period (e.g., 2-3 years), with a guaranteed surrender value plus any accrued bonuses.
How It Works (Example)
Suppose Mr. Sharma, aged 30, buys a Jeevan Lakshya Plan with:

Sum Assured: ₹10,00,000.
Policy Term: 20 years.
Premium Paying Term: 17 years (20 - 3).
If Mr. Sharma survives till maturity (age 50):
He receives ₹10,00,000 + accrued bonuses (e.g., ₹3,00,000, assuming a moderate bonus rate) + Final Additional Bonus (e.g., ₹50,000) = ₹13,50,000 (approx.).
If Mr. Sharma dies in year 5:
From year 6 to year 19, his nominee gets ₹1,00,000 annually (10% of ₹10,00,000) = ₹14,00,000 over 14 years.
At maturity (year 20), the nominee receives ₹11,00,000 (110% of Sum Assured) + bonuses (e.g., ₹3,00,000) = ₹14,00,000.
Total payout: ₹28,00,000 (approx.), spread over time.
